# Project Chronicle: AI-Powered Task & Goal Management

## 1. Project Vision

To create an intelligent, privacy-first digital companion that evolves from a simple daily task tracker into a comprehensive personal project management system. This application will not only help track what gets done but will also provide insights and guidance to help the user achieve their long-term goals, inspired by the mindful productivity philosophy of tools like the Passion Planner.

## 2. Core Philosophy

- **Simplicity First:** The application will start as a minimal, intuitive tool and will gracefully scale in complexity, ensuring the user is never overwhelmed.
    
- **Data-Driven Insights:** The app will learn from the user's own data to provide personalized, actionable insights and suggestions.
    
- **Mindful Productivity:** The focus is on intentionality. The app will encourage daily focus-setting and reflection, connecting daily tasks to larger life goals.
    
- **Privacy-Centric Hybrid AI:** The system is built on a hybrid AI model that prioritizes user privacy by performing most tasks on-device, while leveraging the cloud for powerful, non-sensitive computations and model training.
    

## 3. Target User

Initially, the application is for a single, motivated individual looking to bring structure, tracking, and intelligence to their personal and professional tasks and goals. The architecture will allow for potential expansion to small teams in the future.
