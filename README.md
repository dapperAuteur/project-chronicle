## ‚ú® Core Philosophy

In a world of constant distraction, Chronicle AI is built on a simple premise: **intentional work is effective work.** The application is architected around a powerful core loop designed to foster mindful productivity:

1.  **Set High-Level Goals:** Define your life's big ambitions.
2.  **Break Them Down:** Create tangible **Milestones** for each goal.
3.  **Plan Your Day:** Set a **Daily Focus** by choosing a goal to work towards.
4.  **Execute with Focus:** Create tasks and link them to milestones. Use the integrated **Pomodoro Timer** to perform deep, uninterrupted work.
5.  **Reflect and Grow:** At the end of the day, use the **AI-assisted Daily Reflection** to understand your progress and build momentum.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project was built using a modern, scalable, and type-safe technology stack, demonstrating best practices in web development.

| Category      | Technology / Service                                      |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend** | `Next.js` (App Router), `React`, `TypeScript`, `Tailwind CSS` |
| **Backend** | `Firebase` (Authentication, Firestore Real-time Database) |
| **API Layer** | `Next.js API Routes` (for secure server-side AI calls)    |
| **Deployment**| `Vercel`                                                  |
| **AI** | `Google Gemini API` (Cloud), `Keyword-based models` (On-Device) |

### Architectural Highlights

* **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is composed of small, reusable React components.
* **Custom Hooks:** Logic is decoupled from the UI through custom hooks (`useAuth`, `useFirestore`, `useTimer`, `usePrediction`), making the codebase clean and maintainable.
* **Real-time Data Synchronization:** Leverages Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener to ensure the UI is always up-to-date across all devices, instantly.
* **Offline-First:** Implements Firestore's offline persistence, caching data locally in IndexedDB to provide a seamless user experience even without an internet connection.
* **Secure API Design:** The Google Gemini API key is securely stored in environment variables and only accessed via a dedicated Next.js API route, never exposing it to the client.
